😃 Facial Emotion Detection using Deep Learning and OpenCV
This project is a real-time facial emotion recognition system that uses a trained deep learning model (CNN) to detect and classify human emotions from webcam video feed. It identifies emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, and Neutral using OpenCV and Keras.

🧠 Internship Experience Summary
This project was part of a hands-on internship where I learned and implemented:

🔹 AI & ML Basics – Algorithms, model training & evaluation

🔹 AI + Cloud Integration – Leveraged Azure AI Services

🔹 Generative AI – Explored Microsoft Copilot, NLP, and Computer Vision tools

🔹 AI for Sustainability – Applied AI for real-world impact and leadership development

🛠 Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Keras / TensorFlow
NumPy
Haar Cascades

🧠 Emotions Recognized
😠 Angry

🤢 Disgust

😨 Fear

😀 Happy

😐 Neutral

😢 Sad

😲 Surprise

📌 Notes
The face detection is handled by OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier.

The model is trained on grayscale 48x48 facial expression images.

Model files are not included due to size — you can train your own or contact me for the files(email-shubhamramdhiraj@gmail.com).
